# Define a method display_board that prints a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe Board

#1. Each cell is presented by a string with 3 spaces: <pre>"   "</pre>
#2. Each row has 3 cells, the middle separated by 2 `|` (pipe) characters: <pre>   |   |   </pre>
#3. There are 3 rows, with 2 separating lines of 11 `-` (dash) characters: `-----------`

#In Ruby, it would be written as:
#{}```
#  puts "   |   |   "
#  puts "-----------"
#  puts "   |   |   "
#  puts "-----------"
#  puts "   |   |   "
 #```

def display_board
  puts "   |   |   "
  puts "-----------"
  puts "   |   |   "
  puts "-----------"
  puts "   |   |   "
end
